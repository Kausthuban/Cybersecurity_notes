The below list contains all the good projects or hands-on tasks I came across that is really helpful. I am listing all the good ones according to me, not exhaustive and it's based only on my opinion, I recommend searching on your own for your own opinion. I will sort them based on the difficulty. If I have done the project, I would have the step by step guide to it. The guide might not teach you everything as the point is to learn, not imitate.
